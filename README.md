# Tic Tac Toe

<p>
                    <a href="https://playtictactoe.org/"  target="_blank">Tic Tac Toe</a> is a 2-player game that everyone 
                    has known to love, but when asked to code and test, I found myself never wanting to 
                    play the game again. Being the final Matlab assignment of my intro to engineering class, 
                    Cornerstone of Engineering, we were assigned partners to work with, required to put our 
                    all into it when completing the assignment. Prior to this project, the only coding 
                    experience I had was through other class projects, so I was still a bit nervous when 
                    assigned to create a game in a newly learned coding language. Techniques used while 
                    coding this assignment include loops, functions, and graphs. When all was said and 
                    done, me and my partner vowed that we would never play a game of Tic Tac Toe with each other again.
